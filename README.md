## Overview
These are optional patches provided by the community that can be applied to the RattlesnakeOS build process. The general idea is that you would pick and choose which patches you want from this repository and include them in your own personal repository.

## Submitting Patches
If you want to submit a patch, it needs to assume it is going to be applied from the root of the AOSP build directory. You can look at existing patches to get an idea of how that looks.
